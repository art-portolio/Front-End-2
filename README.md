# Front-End-2

Web application for Unit 2: Web Frontend.

## App Name: Artsy

This app contains two user types. An artist (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view an artist’s portfolio.

## MVP Features:

- [ ] Login Page - After a user logs in, they’ll be directed their portfolio page where they can create a “post”. Each post needs to have an image, description and and upvote section to it. (Think instagram for artists).

- [ ] Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

- [ ] Create Post Page - Allows a user to come in and create a post of their artwork (no need to upload photos for MVP). Stretch goals will include image uploading and the use of Cloudinary API etc.

- [ ] Edit Post Page - User can edit their post descriptions.

- [ ] Home Page for non-logged in users - Navigating to the home page Users can view posts of different artists laid out in a single format. Users can click on a single post to read more of the description etc.
